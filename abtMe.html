            Howdy! I&#39;m Michaela, as you might have gathered, and this is my website. I&#39;m a New York born gal (I&#39;ve only lived in Texas since 2014) and am a proud member of the fightin&#39; Texas Aggie class of 2022! I&#39;m currently working my way to a computer science degree, and I&#39;m super excited to break into industry to make my mark on the world. 
            <br><br>Outside of classes, I&#39;m one of the SWElites co-chairs for the Society of Women Engineers. SWElites is essentially a leadership program for freshmen, and we help develop the fifty women as college students and professionals. All in all, it&#39;s pretty cool and I get to meet a ton of new people through it. I&#39;ve also recently joined <a href="https://tagdigda.wixsite.com/gamedev", target="_blank">Texas Aggie Game Developers</a>, but not much has come of that yet, so updates to come!
            <br><br>I love my dog, Sadie, a border collie mix, but she lives at home with my family. For fun I like to crochet, cross stitch, and occasionally make friendship bracelets. I also love video games, cheese, and podcasts. As I mentioned on the homepage, I love board games. A few of my favorites are Exploding Kittens, Machi Koro, and Power Grid.
