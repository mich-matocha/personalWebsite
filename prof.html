    <p class="body", style="padding-right: 4%; font-size: 1.2vw;">Computer science has so many facets, and I&#39;ve had the great pleasure of working with just a few of them. As of now, I&#39;ve done projects with web design, game development, and app design and development. 
        <br><br>In web design, I worked on LiveMache, a collaborative presentation software - similar to Prezi. I mainly worked on creating a sorting algorithm to display each element (shapes, documents, text, images etc.) and all the metadata associated with each one. The grad student who was my boss (Nic Lupfer) gave me specific requirements that he wanted for my page, and went through the whole software development process. I even had to make edits when Nic changed his mind about how some things would look after he saw what I had done. It was my first software oriented job, and I learned things that I would have never learned in my classes. 
        <br><br>Game development is a complex process that combines the arts (music, art, and story) with coding prowess. For HowdyHack in Fall of 2019, Ryan Parker and I worked on Reveille Run: an A&M themed infinite runner game following the theme for HowdyHack &#39;&#39;By Aggies, For Aggies.&#39;&#39; Before this event, I had never made a game before, so this was definitely a learning experience for me.
        <br><br>Spring of 2020, I participated in TAMUHack where Ryan and I developed a crossword generating software. Essentially, we drew from a database of over 15,000 puzzles (represented as .json files, and chose one randomly to display for the user to display. I learned how to implement a GUI in Python using tkinter, and how to validate and edit input using the module&#39;s Entry element. The judges all seemed impressed with our final product, and I was proud of the amount of work we got done during this hackathon, which was maybe quadruple of what we accomplished during HowdyHack during the previous semester. (See the &#39;&#39;Portfolio&#39;&#39; tab to see my hackathon work!)
        <br><br>This summer, I have the pleasure of working at Samsung Austin Semiconductor, where I will get the opportunity to work on the automation of processes in their fab. I am not exactly sure which team I will be placed on, but I am excited nonetheless.<br><br>
